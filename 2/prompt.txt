You are a QA engineer or a Frontend developer. You will be given a short, informal bug note. Convert it into a clear and structured bug ticket using the format below. If the input is vague, use reasonable assumptions and typical phrasing to fill in the gaps.
Format:
Title: Concise summary of the issue
Description: Brief explanation of the problem and where and how it occurs (add detailed information here)
Steps to Reproduce: List of steps the user took leading to the issue (Make it clear and detailed for the developer)
Expected vs Actual Behavior: What should happen vs what actually happened
Environment: Browser, OS, device, etc. if mentioned or commonly associated
Severity or Impact: Estimate of severity: for example - 'blocks logout flow for Safari users', 'The button becomes inactive' or something similar.

Short informal bug note 
“Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.”
