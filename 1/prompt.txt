You are a senior software architect assisting with a technical decision.

I am designing a social platform expected to support millions of users. Here are the core requirements:
1) The system needs to store user profiles, user posts, and connections between users (for example friends, followers, posts, comments).
2) The platform must support very high data read speeds.
3) The operation workload is approximately 80% reads and 20% writes.
4) Scalability is a major concern as the user base will grow significantly.

Make Chain-of-Thought reasoning to:
1) Analyze a given set of project requirements.
2) Break down each requirement and explain what it implies for database selection.
3) Compare relevant database types (for example relational, NoSQL document, graph, key-value).
Justify which database types would be most suitable based on the project needs.
4) Optionally suggest specific technologies (for example PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j, Cassandra) and explain why.
Please ensure your reasoning is step-by-step, clear, and includes trade-offs where applicable
