Here are the structured analyses for the two samples provided, following the reasoning procedure and JSON output format:

---

### **Sample 1 Analysis**

**Feedback:**

> "Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, \$150 mouse btw"

```json
{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Sensor performance and connectivity of the mouse",
  "positives": [],
  "painPoints": [
    "Sensor intermittently stops tracking",
    "Issue persists even when wired",
    "Faulty dongle on the first unit"
  ],
  "improvementSuggestions": [
    "Improve sensor reliability at high polling rates",
    "Ensure dongle quality control"
  ],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Sensor",
    "8000hz polling rate",
    "Dongle",
    "Wired connection"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Relevance:** Clearly about product performance.
* **Sentiment:** Strongly negative tone and mentions multiple functional issues.
* **Expertise:** Mentions 8000hz (a high polling rate known to performance users), tried wired mode, returned a unit due to dongle failure—implies hands-on knowledge.

### **Sample 2 Analysis**

**Feedback:**

> "Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."

```json
{
  "sentiment": "Mixed",
  "isRelevant": false,
  "mainSubject": null,
  "positives": [],
  "painPoints": [],
  "improvementSuggestions": [],
  "featuresMentioned": [],
  "userExpertise": "Unknown"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Relevance:** This is primarily a price/value judgment, not a technical/product performance comment.
* **Sentiment:** Mixed—likes the product but thinks it's overpriced.
* **No further analysis needed** once relevance is marked false.

Let me know if you'd like this logic wrapped into a function or processing pipeline.
